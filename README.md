# Finimize News Site Challenge:

As part of the process of redesigning the finimize news site, I took into account the fact that the more simple the site is (to navigate and visually pleasing) for the user the quicker and more successful they are to subscribe.

So I divided each news piece into chunks of grids of varying sizes, allowing the user to know from just the title and the image (which I put as background for each news grid) what the news article is about.

Once the user is convinced and would like to sign up for a newsletter, he/she doesn't need to look for the signup button. I placed it visibly at the right hand corner.
